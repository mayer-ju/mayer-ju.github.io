<h3>Research Interests</h3>
<li> <h4> Gradute Research </h4>
I am a fourth year graduate student advised by Professor Ram Seshadri, Professor Tresa Pollock, and Professor Irene Beyerlein. My graduate research examines the relationships between atomic order, microstructure, and magnetism. Please take a look at my publications if you would like to know more about this work.</li>
<li> <h4> Abstract Dynamical Systems </h4> 
I am also broadly interested in dynamical systems and their algebraic properties. Particularly the underlying assumptions that are at work in different models of physics (i.e. classical mechanics, quantum mechanics and their respective field theories). I am certainly no expert, bu I hope some of my blog posts may prove useful to other dynamical systems enthusiasts out there.</li>
<li> <h4> Functional Programming </h4> 
I have also spent some time learning Haskell and the theorem prover Lean. Functional programming is a rather insightful way to understand the striking similarities between computer science and more formal mathematics. I hope to "formalize" some of the ideas I discuss related to dynamical systems with the help of these tools.
