The following posts are inspired by a series of discussions I have been having with a friend in the computer science department at UC Santa Barbara. The story goes like this: 

Over the last couple of years my friend and I have been chatting about the kinds of research problems we are interested in studying. In the process, we realized we have very similar perspectives on how to go about solving problems. Naturally, we could not help ourselves, we had to ask whether there exists a common ground between our fields/interests! And so I set out to try and help my friend get a feel for all the hype that surrounds physics while he tried to map said hype onto formalisms familiar to a computer scientist.    

Of course it has taken longer than originally anticipated for us to get each other up to speed in our respective fields, but the progress we have made has been fairly promising! We found out rather quickly that formalising our respective "languages" with the help of mathematics has been the best way forward and a particularly insightful example of this has been Noether's theorem. In the following posts I will try and unpack some of what we found by summarizing the ideas of a couple key papers we have worked through. Hopefully what follows proves to be useful! I know it has certainly helped me "lift" my understanding of physics from the application at hand to a more abstract algebraic framework. In my opinion this is an especially important thought process to apply to physics, because as the field of physics matures and inevitably becomes more complex, the philosophical questions underpinning the foundations of the field are somewhat lost.
